# Financial-Sentiment-Analysis
This project uses NLP and ML to classify financial text (news, reports, SEC filings) as positive, neutral, or negative. It helps investors and analysts understand market sentiment through text preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, sentiment classification, and visualizations. Future plans include deep learning models and real-time tracking.
